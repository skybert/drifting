Drifting - this is my carage, my basement workshop, my garden of crash test dummies. Here you'll find bits, bytes and pieces of stuff I've tried out.

This is nothing special, nothing grand, just an ordinary man's scribbles.

The name is inspried from Eric Clapton's brilliant "Driftin'" on the
"Unplugged" album.
